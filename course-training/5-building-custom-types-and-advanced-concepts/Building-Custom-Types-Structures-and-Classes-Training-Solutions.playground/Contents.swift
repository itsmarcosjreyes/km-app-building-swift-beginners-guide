/*
 Training 1: Ninja ID
 Instructions:
 Youâ€™re designing a ninja registration system. Create a Ninja struct with properties name (String) and rank (Int). Then, create a Sensei class with properties name (String) and disciples (Array of Ninja). Write a method inside the Ninja struct that allows a ninja to challenge another ninja to a duel, returning true if their rank is higher.

 Goal:
 Build a Ninja struct.
 Add a method to the struct.
 Create a Sensei class.
 Work with class and struct instances.

/*
 Training 4: Identity Crisis
 Instructions:
 Create a Ninja class with properties name (String) and rank (Int). Instantiate two Ninja objects with identical properties. Use the identity operator (===) to check if they are the same instance and print the result.

 Goal:

/*
 Training 6: Samurai Lineage
 Instructions:
 Create a Samurai class with properties name (String) and ancestor (Samurai?). The ancestor property should reference another Samurai object. Implement a method that returns the name of the eldest known ancestor in the lineage (Though we havenâ€™t explored recursion in depth, this is a great practice for a problem you will encounter more often than not in real life ðŸ™‚).

 Goal:
 Build a Samurai class.
 Work with optional properties.
 Implement a recursive method.
